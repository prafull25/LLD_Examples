# Low-Level Design (LLD) Examples in Python

This repository contains **Low-Level Design (LLD)** examples implemented in Python. Each example demonstrates key software design principles, object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, and best practices.

## 📂 Structure
Each LLD example is organized in its own folder. You can navigate to a specific example and run the corresponding `main.py` file to see the demo.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/prafull25/LLD_Examples
   cd LLD_Examples
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired LLD example:
   ```sh
   cd SplitWise #example
   ```
3. Run the `main.py` file:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## 📌 Requirements
- Python 3.x installed
- No additional dependencies unless specified in the respective example folders

## 📌 LLD Implementations
1. 🎲 **[Snake and Ladder](./SnakeAndLadder/)** – A board game simulation with players, dice, snakes, and ladders.
2. ❌ **[Tic-Tac-Toe](./TicTacToeLLD/)** – A turn-based multiplayer game with a 3x3 grid.
3. 💰 **[Splitwise](./SplitWise/)** – A simplified expense-sharing system.
